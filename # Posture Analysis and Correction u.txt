# Posture Analysis and Correction using Mediapipe

## Overview
This project is a **real-time posture analysis system** using **OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Tkinter**. It detects posture defects based on **pose landmarks**, analyzes the user's stance, and provides corrective exercises. It also includes a **thumbs-up gesture detection** feature for image capture and analysis.

## Features
- **Real-time posture detection** using Mediapipe's Pose module.
- **Posture classification** into categories like *Slouching, Uneven Shoulders, Forward Head, Kyphosis, and Swayback*.
- **Hand gesture detection** (Thumbs-Up) to trigger image capture.
- **Multi-angle image analysis** (Front, Side, and Back views).
- **Tkinter GUI** displaying detected posture defects and corresponding fixes.
- **Automatic logging** of posture issues and recommended corrective exercises.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** (Computer Vision)
- **Mediapipe** (Pose & Hand Tracking)
- **NumPy** (Numerical Computation)
- **Tkinter** (GUI for Posture Fixes Display)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy tkinter
```

## Usage
### Running the Posture Analysis
Run the script using:
```bash
python posture_analysis.py
```
### Workflow
1. **Turn to the specified angle** (*Front, Side, or Back*), and the system will guide you.
2. **Show a thumbs-up gesture** to trigger image capture.
3. The system will analyze your posture and **log detected defects**.
4. A **Tkinter window** will pop up with corrective exercises.
5. **Press 'q'** to exit the program at any time.

## Posture Defects and Fixes
The system detects and suggests exercises for:
- **Slouching:** Strengthen core, thoracic extension exercises.
- **Forward Head Posture:** Chin tucks, neck stretches.
- **Uneven Shoulders:** Scapular retraction, dumbbell shrugs.
- **Rounded Shoulders:** Reverse flys, chest stretches.
- **Kyphosis (Hunchback):** Cobra stretch, superman exercise.
- **Swayback:** Glute bridges, pelvic tilts.
- **Leaning Forward/Backward:** Core strengthening, balance exercises.

## Example Output
```
Posture Issues Detected:
- Severe Slouching
- Uneven Shoulders
- Possible Forward Head
Recommended Fixes:
1. Chin Tucks
2. Shoulder Retraction Exercises
3. Wall Posture Check
```

## Future Improvements
- Add **Real-time Voice Feedback** for posture correction.
- Improve **Posture Detection Accuracy** with more ML-based evaluation.
- Develop a **Web App Version** using Flask or Streamlit.
